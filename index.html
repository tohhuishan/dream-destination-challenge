      <div class="hero-text-wrapper rounded">
        <p>
          Osaka is Japan’s third-largest city and was the country’s first
          capital. It is considered a vital economic center in Japan and
          currently is home to the largest seaport in Japan and many leading
          Japanese manufacturers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Osaka city is also deemed a <strong>culinary paradise</strong>: its
          nickname Tenka no Daidokoro (or 天下の台所) means the nation’s
          kitchen.

            <h3>Udon & Udonsuki</h3>
            <p>
              In Osaka, udon noodles are famed for the way that their softness
              harmonizes gently with the kombu and skipjack-accented broth. One
              age-old favorite is salty-sweet kitsune udon, where the noodles
              are topped with fried tofu boiled to plump perfection.
            </p>
            <p>
              Kitsune udon is available throughout Japan, but Osaka’s kitsune
              udon, such as at Dotonbori Imai and Usamitei Matsubaya in
              Minamisemba, is particularly delicious. This is because of the
              quality of the dashi (ingredients include kombu, dried mackerel
              flakes, and round herring flakes).

            <h3>Sushi</h3>
            <p>
              Osaka’s famous style of sushi is pressed sushi. “Box sushi” is one
              example: the toppings and vinegared rice are placed into a square
              wooden mold and pressed to fit. Watching the process of pressing
              box sushi is mesmeric.
            </p>
            <p>
              The rice is boiled using kombu cooking stock, and flavored with
              sugar and mirin (sweet cooking saké). And because this is such a
              popular flavor in Osaka, numerous local shops also use sugared
              rice when serving hand-pressed sushi.

            <h3>Takoyaki</h3>
            <p>
              The most famous Osaka fast food, takoyaki octopus dumplings
              embodies the Osaka waste-not-want-not ethos, wherein the abundant
              catch of octopus from Osaka Bay was put straight to good use in
              the form of dumplings.
            </p>

            <p>
              Served in boat-shaped bamboo dishes, the piping hot balls are
              picked up and ferried into one’s mouth using toothpicks—with the
              perfect takoyaki featuring a crisped skin and tender filling. An
              Osaka classic topped with Worcestershire sauce, ginger and seaweed
              flakes.

            <h3>Okonomiyaki</h3>
            <p>
              Along with takoyaki, this dish may rightly be described as Osaka
              soul food. While both dishes involve dissolving flour in dashi,
              okonomiyaki includes cabbage—a non-negotiable ingredient—usually
              along with pork, as well as whichever additional ingredients you
              like.
            </p>
            <p>
              A thin layer of batter is spread out in a circle atop an iron
              griddle, and the brow my-5ned savory pancake is then served with
              toppings such as sauce, mayonnaise and powdered seaweed—a serving
              style that is in turn said to have influenced takoyaki. The Osaka
              version features the addition of yamaimo (yam) to the batter,
              providing a lovely fluffiness.

            <h3>Kami-nabe</h3>
            <p>
              Japan’s various regions are home to local hot pots, and Osaka is
              no exception. An Osaka original is the mysterious kami-nabe (paper
              hot pot). The idea of putting a fire under paper is shocking—but
              this dish indeed features a sheet of paper set atop a wire rack,
              which is then heated using a charcoal fire. Washi paper is treated
              via a special process, and the presence of the dashi ensures that
              the paper itself will not burn.

                The area around Eiraku Dam is planted with 700 flowering sakura
                trees, including the Yoshino cherry species. There’s a
                two-kilometer circuit built around the dam’s pond, perfect for
                strolling or jogging. Additionally, the whole area around the

                A natural park (quasi-national park) of arresting scenic beauty
                with 100- to 600- meter high mountains in the northern part of
                Mino City. In the park a long gorge runs through forests from
                the magnificent Mino Waterfall, about 33 m high and 5 m wide,
                forming a habitat for 980 species of plants and over 3,000
                species of insects. Located in precious natural forests in Osaka
                Prefecture, the park is the western starting point of the Tokai
                Natural Trail. Visitors can enjoy seasonal changes in the
                scenery, such as cherry blossoms in spring, trees covered with
                ice and hanging icicles in winter and especially the brilliantly
                colored leaves late in fall. The Mino Mountains are an ancient
                sacred site of Mountain Buddhism, where there are old temples,
                including Ryuanji Temple (otherwise known as Mino Temple), an
                important training center said to have been established by
                En-no-gyoja, the founder of Shugendo. Mino Insect Museum, which
                is located on the way to the waterfall, is also well known. At
                the museum visitors can see not only about 10,000 samples of
                insects, but also over 200 live butterflies of about 30 species,
                and learn about their year-round ecology.

                Ajigawa river. In 1958, the mountain opened as a park. There is

                  temples and the first ever to be built by the state. It was
                  founded in 593 by Prince Shotoku, who supported the
                  introduction of Buddhism into Japan. Although the temple's
                  buildings burned down several times throughout the centuries,
                  they were always carefully reconstructed to reflect the
                  original 6th century design.

                  shrine of the Namba district. Although the shrine was once
                  prosperous enough to have a shichido garan (seven standard
                  buildings of a Buddhist temple complex), it declined due to
                  wartime fires. After the Meiji Restoration of the 19th
                  century, the temple was abolished because of a government
                  edict ordering the separation of Shintoism and Buddhism, and
                  in 1945, the shrine's buildings were burned down in air raids.
                  The current shrine buildings are post-war reconstructions. The
                  enormous lion head-shaped building, measuring 12 meters high,
                  11 meters wide, is particularly eye-catching. The Tug-of-War
                  Ritual, held annually on the third Sunday in January, is based
                  on a Japanese myth that Susano-no-Mikoto, the enshrined deity,
                  killed the large serpent god, Yamata-no-orochi, freeing the
                  people from hardship. In 2001, this ritual was designated
                  Osaka City's first intangible folk cultural property.

                  Located between buildings in Doshomachi, an area traditionally
                  known for medicine, the deities enshrined here are worshiped
                  as the gods of health and medicine. Sukunahikona-no-Mikoto,
                  the Japanese god of medicine, and Shinno-Entei, the Chinese
                  god of medicine, are both enshrined here, and the shrine is
                  known as Shinno-san. The shrine was believed to have been
                  founded in 1780, when Shinno, already enshrined at an assembly
                  hall for pharmacists, was brought, along with the divided
                  spirit of Sukunahikona-no-Mikoto, from a shrine in Kyoto and
                  enshrined together. The papier-mache tiger, a popular Osaka
                  souvenir said to protect its owner from illnesses, is this
                  shrine's charm. Legend says that during a cholera epidemic in
                  Osaka, people where healed when the papier-mache tiger charms
                  were given out free of charge along with medicine.
                  Papier-mache tigers are given out at the shrine's annual
                  Shinno Festival, held November 22nd - 23rd.

                  Together with Imamiya Ebisu Shrine to the south, Horikawa
                  Ebisu is beloved by the locals and known as Kita-no-Ebessan
                  (Northern Ebisu shrine). They say the shrine was founded in
                  the 6th century when Tomi-no-Muraji Yoshio, having received a
                  divine revelation from the god Ebisu, picked up a ball in a
                  reedy marsh in Horie and enshrined it as a holy spirit in
                  Tomishima, Namba. The shrine was moved to its current location
                  around the year 1352. The shrine is flooded with worshippers
                  annually on the day of the Toka Ebisu Festival, all
                  enthusiastically chanting exhortations for success in
                  business. The small Enoki Shrine, commonly referred to as
                  Danjiri-Inari, is also located on the shrine grounds. Many
                  people make offerings of small danjiri float models or ema
                  (prayer boards) to the shrine when their prayers are answered.

                  The god, "Ikasuri-no-Okami" (known as Zama-san for short) is
                  enshrined here, at one of the most important shrines in the
                  Osaka area. They say the shrine was founded when Ikasuri
                  Daijin was enshrined as a protective deity for the capital
                  during the reign of the first emperor. Worshippers visit the
                  shrine praying for safety in the home, when traveling, and in
                  childbirth. The Manyoshu, Japan's oldest collection of poetry,
                  includes a waka poem about praying at Ikasuri before setting
                  off on a journey. Prayers were offered here for the Empress
                  Jingu when she gave birth, and more recently for the Meiji
                  Emperor's birth. The shrine is very old. They say it was
                  established when Empress Jingu enshrined Ikasuri-no-okami
                  here. It is also listed in Japan's ancient code of law, the
                  Engishiki, as the region's sole grand shrine.

                  Kumata Shrine is said to have been established in 862 when
                  Susano-no-Mikoto was enshrined in the first pavilion as the
                  patron god of the area. In later years, Kumanosansha's gods
                  were enshrined in the second pavilion, and Izanami-no-Mikoto
                  and other gods were enshrined in the third. All three
                  pavilions are recognized as national important cultural
                  properties. As Japan's last remaining location for renga
                  ("chain-poem") poetry, renga poetry events are regularly held
                  here. On the shrine grounds stands a large camphor tree
                  (designated a prefectural natural monument) said to be 1,000
                  years old, and also a large 500-year-old ginkgo tree named
                  "Tarachine-no-icho." Praying to the tree is said to help make
                  it easier to breastfeed and cure breast-related illnesses. A
                  ritual known as Otaue-shinji (recognized as an intangible folk
                  cultural property) is held annually on April 13th to pray for
                  abundant harvests and financial luck. During the ritual, seeds
                  from the gods are scattered within the hall of worship.

                  Dainenbutsuji Temple is the head temple of the Yuzu Nembutsu
                  School of Pure Land Buddhism. The main hall is the largest
                  wooden structure in Osaka Prefecture. Additionally, the temple
                  holds ornamental hanging scrolls that are national treasures
                  as well as ancient texts that are designated Important
                  Cultural Properties. The temple is famous for its "O-juzu
                  Kuri" ritual held on the 16th of January, May, and September
                  each year, in which worshippers go through a massive string of
                  prayer beads together while reciting sutras. The temple's
                  "Manbu Oneri" procession is held from May 1st through 5th
                  every year, and involves a procession of 100 parishioners and
                  children followed by 25 monks clad in golden masks and vibrant
                  attire. The procession moves along with traditional gagaku
                  court music. Afterwards, the monks in bodhisattva garb make
                  ritual offerings of flowers, and the parishioners collectively
                  put their hands together to pray for their ancestors. The
                  Manbu Oneri procession was designated an Osaka City Intangible
                  Folk Cultural Property in 2002.

                  Horikoshi Shrine is said to have been built during the reign
                  of the 33rd emperor while Shitennoji Temple was under
                  construction, Prince Shotoku established this shrine in memory
                  of his uncle, the 32nd emperor of Japan. Horikoshi is one of
                  Shitennoji's seven shrines.There was a beautiful canal to the
                  south of the premises until the Meiji period. They say the
                  shrine was named "Horikoshi" because visitors to the shrine
                  had to cross (koshi) the canal (hori).The ancient "Kubotsu
                  Oji" shrine is also located on the shrine grounds. Although
                  the shrine faces busy Tanimachi-suji, it has a number of trees
                  - some of which are hundreds of years old - that make the
                  shrine itself a very quiet place. The people of Osaka even
                  have a saying about the historically beloved shrine, "The god

                  believed to have been established on the grounds of Namba
