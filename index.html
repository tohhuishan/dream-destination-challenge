        <p>
          Osaka is Japan’s third-largest city and was the country’s first
          capital. It is considered a vital economic center in Japan and
          currently is home to the largest seaport in Japan and many leading
          Japanese manufacturers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Osaka city is also deemed a <strong>culinary paradise</strong>: its
          nickname Tenka no Daidokoro (or 天下の台所) means the nation’s
          kitchen.

            <h3>Udon & Udonsuki</h3>
            <p>
              In Osaka, udon noodles are famed for the way that their softness
              harmonizes gently with the kombu and skipjack-accented broth. One
              age-old favorite is salty-sweet kitsune udon, where the noodles
              are topped with fried tofu boiled to plump perfection.
            </p>
            <p>
              Kitsune udon is available throughout Japan, but Osaka’s kitsune
              udon, such as at Dotonbori Imai and Usamitei Matsubaya in
              Minamisemba, is particularly delicious. This is because of the
              quality of the dashi (ingredients include kombu, dried mackerel
              flakes, and round herring flakes).
            </p>

            <h3>Sushi</h3>
            <p>
              Osaka’s famous style of sushi is pressed sushi. “Box sushi” is one
              example: the toppings and vinegared rice are placed into a square
              wooden mold and pressed to fit. Watching the process of pressing
              box sushi is mesmeric.
            </p>
            <p>
              The rice is boiled using kombu cooking stock, and flavored with
              sugar and mirin (sweet cooking saké). And because this is such a
              popular flavor in Osaka, numerous local shops also use sugared
              rice when serving hand-pressed sushi.

            <h3>Takoyaki</h3>
            <p>
              The most famous Osaka fast food, takoyaki octopus dumplings
              embodies the Osaka waste-not-want-not ethos, wherein the abundant
              catch of octopus from Osaka Bay was put straight to good use in
              the form of dumplings.
            </p>

            <p>
              Served in boat-shaped bamboo dishes, the piping hot balls are
              picked up and ferried into one’s mouth using toothpicks—with the
              perfect takoyaki featuring a crisped skin and tender filling. An
              Osaka classic topped with Worcestershire sauce, ginger and seaweed
              flakes.

            <h3>Okonomiyaki</h3>
            <p>
              Along with takoyaki, this dish may rightly be described as Osaka
              soul food. While both dishes involve dissolving flour in dashi,
              okonomiyaki includes cabbage—a non-negotiable ingredient—usually
              along with pork, as well as whichever additional ingredients you
              like.
            </p>
            <p>
              A thin layer of batter is spread out in a circle atop an iron
              griddle, and the brow my-5ned savory pancake is then served with
              toppings such as sauce, mayonnaise and powdered seaweed—a serving
              style that is in turn said to have influenced takoyaki. The Osaka
              version features the addition of yamaimo (yam) to the batter,
              providing a lovely fluffiness.

            <h3>Kami-nabe</h3>
            <p>
              Japan’s various regions are home to local hot pots, and Osaka is
              no exception. An Osaka original is the mysterious kami-nabe (paper
              hot pot). The idea of putting a fire under paper is shocking—but
              this dish indeed features a sheet of paper set atop a wire rack,
              which is then heated using a charcoal fire. Washi paper is treated
              via a special process, and the presence of the dashi ensures that
              the paper itself will not burn.

                The area around Eiraku Dam is planted with 700 flowering sakura

                two-kilometer circuit built around the dam’s pond, perfect for

                A natural park (quasi-national park) of arresting scenic beauty
                with 100- to 600- meter high mountains in the northern part of
                Mino City. In the park a long gorge runs through forests from
                the magnificent Mino Waterfall, about 33 m high and 5 m wide,
                forming a habitat for 980 species of plants and over 3,000
                species of insects. Located in precious natural forests in Osaka
                Prefecture, the park is the western starting point of the Tokai
                Natural Trail. Visitors can enjoy seasonal changes in the
                scenery, such as cherry blossoms in spring, trees covered with
                ice and hanging icicles in winter and especially the brilliantly
                colored leaves late in fall. The Mino Mountains are an ancient
                sacred site of Mountain Buddhism, where there are old temples,
                including Ryuanji Temple (otherwise known as Mino Temple), an
                important training center said to have been established by
                En-no-gyoja, the founder of Shugendo. Mino Insect Museum, which
                is located on the way to the waterfall, is also well known. At
                the museum visitors can see not only about 10,000 samples of
                insects, but also over 200 live butterflies of about 30 species,
                and learn about their year-round ecology.

                In this park, you'll find Mt. Tempo, the smallest mountain in
                Japan with a height of only 4.5 meters. It was created in the
                1830s by piling up sediment dredged from construction on the
                Ajigawa river. In 1958, the mountain opened as a park. There is

                the new government warship in the first year of the Meiji period

                Tsurumiryokuchi Park is located at the site of The International
                Garden and Greenery Exposition 1990, a world exhibition that
                featured the beauty of flowers. After the Expo, the site was
                turned into a memorial park which was designed to have flowers
                in bloom in every season. The park is 123 hectares in area, and
                has a large central pond. A windmill, the symbol of the park,
                stands on a hillside, while tulips, salvias, cosmos and other
                flowers blossom in every season. The park features grass fields,
                farms and rice paddies, and forests and ponds where you can
                observe insects, thousands of ducks and about 100 species of
                wild birds. There is also a Japanese garden with a tea ceremony
                house in Hanamizuki Hall, and the International Garden which
                uses a variety of soils from different parts of the world. In
                addition, the park has streams and playground equipment where
                children can play, a camping and barbecue site, a horseback
                riding ground, an all-season swimming pool and a sports center,
                among other recreational facilities and nature observation and
                experience sites.

                  Shitennoji (四天王寺) is one of Japan's oldest temples and the
                  first ever to be built by the state. It was founded in 593 by
                  Prince Shotoku, who supported the introduction of Buddhism
                  into Japan. Although the temple's buildings burned down
                  several times throughout the centuries, they were always
                  carefully reconstructed to reflect the original 6th century
                  design.

                  Namba Yasaka Shrine has long been worshipped as the tutelary
                  shrine of the Namba district. Although the shrine was once
                  prosperous enough to have a shichido garan (seven standard
                  buildings of a Buddhist temple complex), it declined due to
                  wartime fires. After the Meiji Restoration of the 19th
                  century, the temple was abolished because of a government
                  edict ordering the separation of Shintoism and Buddhism, and
                  in 1945, the shrine's buildings were burned down in air raids.
                  The current shrine buildings are post-war reconstructions. The
                  enormous lion head-shaped building, measuring 12 meters high,
                  11 meters wide, is particularly eye-catching. The Tug-of-War
                  Ritual, held annually on the third Sunday in January, is based
                  on a Japanese myth that Susano-no-Mikoto, the enshrined deity,
                  killed the large serpent god, Yamata-no-orochi, freeing the
                  people from hardship. In 2001, this ritual was designated
                  Osaka City's first intangible folk cultural property.

                  Located between buildings in Doshomachi, an area traditionally
                  known for medicine, the deities enshrined here are worshiped
                  as the gods of health and medicine. Sukunahikona-no-Mikoto,
                  the Japanese god of medicine, and Shinno-Entei, the Chinese
                  god of medicine, are both enshrined here, and the shrine is
                  known as Shinno-san. The shrine was believed to have been
                  founded in 1780, when Shinno, already enshrined at an assembly
                  hall for pharmacists, was brought, along with the divided
                  spirit of Sukunahikona-no-Mikoto, from a shrine in Kyoto and
                  enshrined together. The papier-mache tiger, a popular Osaka
                  souvenir said to protect its owner from illnesses, is this
                  shrine's charm. Legend says that during a cholera epidemic in
                  Osaka, people where healed when the papier-mache tiger charms
                  were given out free of charge along with medicine.
                  Papier-mache tigers are given out at the shrine's annual
                  Shinno Festival, held November 22nd - 23rd.

                  Ebisu is beloved by the locals and known as Kita-no-Ebessan
                  (Northern Ebisu shrine). They say the shrine was founded in
                  the 6th century when Tomi-no-Muraji Yoshio, having received a
                  divine revelation from the god Ebisu, picked up a ball in a
                  reedy marsh in Horie and enshrined it as a holy spirit in
                  Tomishima, Namba. The shrine was moved to its current location
                  around the year 1352. The shrine is flooded with worshippers
                  annually on the day of the Toka Ebisu Festival, all
                  enthusiastically chanting exhortations for success in
                  business. The small Enoki Shrine, commonly referred to as
                  Danjiri-Inari, is also located on the shrine grounds. Many
                  people make offerings of small danjiri float models or ema
                  (prayer boards) to the shrine when their prayers are answered.

                  The god, "Ikasuri-no-Okami" (known as Zama-san for short) is
                  enshrined here, at one of the most important shrines in the
                  Osaka area. They say the shrine was founded when Ikasuri
                  Daijin was enshrined as a protective deity for the capital
                  during the reign of the first emperor. Worshippers visit the
                  shrine praying for safety in the home, when traveling, and in
                  childbirth. The Manyoshu, Japan's oldest collection of poetry,
                  includes a waka poem about praying at Ikasuri before setting
                  off on a journey. Prayers were offered here for the Empress
                  Jingu when she gave birth, and more recently for the Meiji
                  Emperor's birth. The shrine is very old. They say it was
                  established when Empress Jingu enshrined Ikasuri-no-okami
                  here. It is also listed in Japan's ancient code of law, the
                  Engishiki, as the region's sole grand shrine.

                  Kumata Shrine is said to have been established in 862 when
                  Susano-no-Mikoto was enshrined in the first pavilion as the
                  patron god of the area. In later years, Kumanosansha's gods
                  were enshrined in the second pavilion, and Izanami-no-Mikoto
                  and other gods were enshrined in the third. All three
                  pavilions are recognized as national important cultural
                  properties. As Japan's last remaining location for renga
                  ("chain-poem") poetry, renga poetry events are regularly held
                  here. On the shrine grounds stands a large camphor tree
                  (designated a prefectural natural monument) said to be 1,000
                  years old, and also a large 500-year-old ginkgo tree named
                  "Tarachine-no-icho." Praying to the tree is said to help make
                  it easier to breastfeed and cure breast-related illnesses. A
                  ritual known as Otaue-shinji (recognized as an intangible folk
                  cultural property) is held annually on April 13th to pray for
                  abundant harvests and financial luck. During the ritual, seeds
                  from the gods are scattered within the hall of worship.

                  wooden structure in Osaka Prefecture. Additionally, the temple
                  holds ornamental hanging scrolls that are national treasures
                  as well as ancient texts that are designated Important
                  Cultural Properties. The temple is famous for its "O-juzu
                  Kuri" ritual held on the 16th of January, May, and September
                  each year, in which worshippers go through a massive string of
                  prayer beads together while reciting sutras. The temple's
                  "Manbu Oneri" procession is held from May 1st through 5th
                  every year, and involves a procession of 100 parishioners and
                  children followed by 25 monks clad in golden masks and vibrant
                  attire. The procession moves along with traditional gagaku
                  court music. Afterwards, the monks in bodhisattva garb make
                  ritual offerings of flowers, and the parishioners collectively
                  put their hands together to pray for their ancestors. The
                  Manbu Oneri procession was designated an Osaka City Intangible
                  Folk Cultural Property in 2002.

                  Horikoshi Shrine is said to have been built during the reign
                  of the 33rd emperor while Shitennoji Temple was under
                  construction, Prince Shotoku established this shrine in memory
                  of his uncle, the 32nd emperor of Japan. Horikoshi is one of
                  Shitennoji's seven shrines.There was a beautiful canal to the
                  south of the premises until the Meiji period. They say the
                  shrine was named "Horikoshi" because visitors to the shrine
                  had to cross (koshi) the canal (hori).The ancient "Kubotsu
                  Oji" shrine is also located on the shrine grounds. Although
                  the shrine faces busy Tanimachi-suji, it has a number of trees
                  - some of which are hundreds of years old - that make the
                  shrine itself a very quiet place. The people of Osaka even
                  have a saying about the historically beloved shrine, "The god
                  of Horikoshi will grant you a once in a lifetime wish."

                  The shrine, dedicated to the 16th emperor of Japan, was
                  believed to have been established on the grounds of Namba
                  Kozugu's ruins in the year 866. The shrine was moved to its
                  present location in 1583 when Toyotomi Hideyoshi constructed
                  Osaka Castle. However, the shrine was completely lost to fire
                  during the air raids of World War II. Known as a location for
                  classical rakugo comic storytelling performances, the shrine
                  has long enjoyed popularity as a cultural center amongst the
                  people of Osaka. The tradition is still alive and well today.
                  The fifth generation rakugo master of the Bunshi Katsura
                  family regularly performs here. There's even a statue of
                  Bunshi Katsura on the shrine grounds. Kozugu's spring cherry
                  blossom viewing festival is always sure to draw crowds, with
                  the night cherry blossoms being considered especially
                  beautiful.

                      The shamisen is a stringed instrument and one of the
                      traditional musical instruments of Japan. It comprises a
                      wooden body covered with animal or synthetic skin and a
                      long neck on which strings are strung and plucked. The
                      appeal of the shamisen lies, more than anything, in its
                      versatility in musical expressions.

                      From long ago, Kabuki actors have studied traditional
                      Japanese dance. Through dancing, actors are able to learn
                      much about how to move their bodies properly. Indeed, the

                      Heritage. In some of the performances, subtitles are
                      available in English, Chinese and Korean. In addition to
                      traditional performances, Yamamoto Noh Theater organizes
                      various programs for visitors: tours of the Noh stage and
                      dressing rooms, lectures on Noh plays, trying on Noh
                      costumes and classes in "utai" - Noh chant. Under the
                      guidance of Noh masters, visitors can walk on the Noh
                      stage with masks on, and try playing musical instruments
                      used in Noh performances. Moreover, Yamamoto Noh Theater
                      can arrange special programs of “taiken”, or "hands-on
                      experience", for visitors to take a lesson in traditional
                      performing arts.

                      Matsuyamachisuji is a roughly 1 km-long north-south street
                      in Osaka City's Chuo Ward that has more than 100 wholesale
                      and specialist stores selling Japanese dolls (like hina
                      ningyo), toys, candy and Japanese paper. Matsuyamachi is
                      pronounced "Matchamachi" by local people, which gave rise
                      to its nickname "Gotchamachi." True to this nickname
                      ("gotcha" means jumble), local Osakans used to think of
                      Matsuyamachi as a place that supplies goods for every
                      occasion: prior to May the place would be packed with
                      people buying gogatsu ningyo (dolls for the Boys' Festival
                      in May). Once that is over, Matsuyamachi stocks up on
                      summer merchandise like fireworks and swimming rings to
                      await the next wave of customers. More recently the street
                      is increasingly visited by younger people seeking out the
                      old-fashioned terraced houses that still remain in the
                      area.

                      "Tate" theatrical combat with sword fighting is a special
                      technique learned by professionals in stage and film
                      industries and is also a part of traditional Japanese
                      culture. At the "dojo" training hall, the "Naniwa Samurai
                      Ambassador" gives Tate lessons and shows to beginners and
                      the public for their fun learning of sword fighting.
                      Courses for overseas visitors, with souvenir photo
                      sessions in kimono, are also available. Why don't you try

                      Renjishi (連獅子), or Two Lions, is a kabuki dance with
                      lyrics written by Kawatake Mokuami, choreography by
                      Hanayagi Jusuke I and music by Kineya Shojiro III and
                      Kineya Katsusaburo II, first performed in 1872. Originally
                      staged for a private dance recital in 1861, it was later
                      expanded and reused in July 1872 as the fourth act for
                      another play at the Murayama-za in Tokyo. Renjishi
                      continued to evolve, with two different sets of music
                      being used (both still performed), and the comic interlude
                      added in 1901. A later version was created for one father
                      and two lion cubs. One of many kabuki works based on the
                      noh play Shakkyo (The Stone Bridge), in the last stages of
                      Renjishi development as a kabuki dance it was brought
                      closer back to the noh version. In particular, in the
                      February 1901 performance at the Tokyo-za, Renjishi was
                      turned into a matsubame mono (pine-board play), modifying
                      the stage to replicate the noh stage's green pine tree
                      background. It is a popular dance in the kabuki repertoire
                      that is often performed.
